A test runner that builds tests with rustc or cargo (or any other compiler
with some configuration effort) and compares the output of the compiler with
a file that you check into git. This allows you to test how your libraries
show up to your users when the library is used wrongly and emits errors.

## Usage

See [examples directory](examples) for how to use this in your own crate.
To be able to use it with `cargo test`, you need to put

```toml
[[test]]
name = "your_test_file"
harness = false
```

into your `Cargo.toml`, otherwise `cargo test` will only look for `#[test]`s and
not run your `fn main()` that actually executes `ui_test`

## Implicit (and possibly surprising) behavior

* Tests are run in order of their filenames (files first, then recursing into folders).
  So if you have any slow tests, prepend them with a small integral number to make them get run first, taking advantage of parallelism as much as possible (instead of waiting for the slow tests at the end).
* `cargo test --test your_test_name -- --help` lists the commands you can specify for filtering, blessing and making your tests less verbose.
    * Since `cargo test` on its own runs all tests, using `cargo test -- --check` will not work on its own, but `cargo test -- --quiet` and `cargo test -- some_test_name` will work just fine, as the CLI matches.
* if there is a `.stdin` file with the same filename as your test, it will be piped as standard input to your program.

## Supported comment annotations

If your test tests for failure, you need to add a `//~` annotation where the error is happening
to ensure that the test will always keep failing at the annotated line. This will match any substring
of the error. These comments can take two forms:

* `//~ LEVEL: XXX` matches by error level and message text
    * `LEVEL` can be one of the following (descending order): `ERROR`, `HELP`, `WARN`, `NOTE` or `ICE`
    * If a level is specified explicitly, *all* diagnostics of that level or higher need an annotation. To avoid this see `//@require-annotations-for-level`
    * This checks the output *before* normalization, so you can check things that get normalized away, but need to
        be careful not to accidentally have a pattern that differs between platforms.
    * if `XXX` is of the form `/XXX/` it is treated as a regex instead of a substring and will succeed if the regex matches.
* `//~ CODE` matches by diagnostic code.
    * `CODE` can take multiple forms such as: `E####`, `lint_name`, `tool::lint_name`.
    * This will only match a diagnostic at the `ERROR` level.

In order to change how a single test is tested, you can add various `//@` comments to the test.
Any other comments will be ignored, and all `//@` comments must be formatted precisely as
their command specifies, or the test will fail without even being run.

* `//@ignore-C` avoids running the test when condition `C` is met.
    * `C` can be `target: XXX YYY`, which checks whether the target triple contains `XXX` or `YYY`.
    * `C` can be `host: XXX YYY`, which checks whether the host triple contains `XXX` or `YYY`.
    * `C` can also be `bitwidth:` followed by one or more space separated integer size like `64`, `32` or `16`.
    * `C` can also be `on-host`, which will only run the test during cross compilation testing.
* `//@only-C` **only** runs the test when condition `C` is met. The conditions are the same as with `ignore`.
* `//@needs-asm-support` **only** runs the test when the target supports `asm!`.
* `//@stderr-per-bitwidth` produces one stderr file per bitwidth, as they may differ significantly sometimes
* `//@error-in-other-file: XXX` can be used to check for errors that can't have `//~` patterns due to being reported in other files.
* `//@revisions: XXX YYY` runs the test once for each space separated name in the list
    * emits one stderr file per revision
    * `//~` comments can be restricted to specific revisions by adding the revision name after the `~` in square brackets: `//~[XXX]`
    * `//@` comments can be restricted to specific revisions by adding the revision name after the `@` in square brackets: `//@[XXX]`
        * Note that you cannot add revisions to the `revisions` command.

    For example:

    ```rust
    //@revisions: edition2021 edition2024
    //@[edition2021] edition:2021
    //@[edition2024] edition:2024
    //@[edition2024] check-pass

    // Then in code:
    let x = 12; //~[edition2021] dead_code
    let x = 12;
    //~[edition2021]^ dead_code
    ```
* `//@compile-flags: XXX` appends `XXX` to the command line arguments passed to the rustc driver
    * you can specify this multiple times, and all the flags will accumulate
* `//@rustc-env: XXX=YYY` sets the env var `XXX` to `YYY` for the rustc driver execution.
    * for Miri these env vars are used during compilation via rustc and during the emulation of the program
    * you can specify this multiple times, accumulating all the env vars
* `//@normalize-stderr-test: "REGEX" -> "REPLACEMENT"` replaces all matches of `REGEX` in the stderr with `REPLACEMENT`. The replacement may specify `$1` and similar backreferences to paste captures. Note that this
doesn't apply to error strings specified by `//~` comments.
    * you can specify multiple such commands, there is no need to create a single regex that handles multiple replacements that you want to perform.
* `//@require-annotations-for-level: LEVEL` can be used to change the level of diagnostics that require a corresponding annotation.
    * this is only useful if there are any annotations like `HELP`, `WARN` or `NOTE`, as these would automatically require annotations for all other diagnostics of the same or higher level.
* `//@check-pass` requires that a test has no error annotations, emits no errors, and exits successfully with exit/status code 0.
* `//@edition: EDITION` overwrites the default edition (2021) to the given edition.
* `//@no-rustfix` do not run [rustfix] on tests that have machine applicable suggestions.
* `//@aux-build: filename` looks for a file in the `auxiliary` directory (within the directory of the test), compiles it as a library and links the current crate against it. This allows you import the crate with `extern crate` or just via `use` statements. This will automatically detect aux files that are proc macros and build them as proc macros.
* `//@run` compiles the test and runs the resulting binary. The resulting binary must exit successfully. Stdout and stderr are taken from the resulting binary. Any warnings during compilation are ignored.
    * You can also specify a different exit code/status that is expected via e.g. `//@run: 1` or `//@run: 101` (the latter is the standard Rust exit code for panics).
    * run tests collect the run output into `.run.stderr` and `.run.stdout` respectively.
    * if a `.run.stdin` file exists, it will be piped as standard input to your test's execution.

## Significant differences to compiletest-rs

* target selection is done via `ignore-target: xxx` and `only-target: xxx` instead of compiletest's
  `ignore-xxx`/`only-xxx`. The `xxx` must also be a substring of the target triple; special
  collections such as `macos`/`unix` in compiletest is not supported.
* only supports `ui` tests
* tests are run in named order, so you can prefix slow tests with `0` in order to make them get run first
* `aux-build`s require specifying nested aux builds explicitly and will not allow you to reference sibling `aux-build`s' artifacts.
