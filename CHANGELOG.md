## [0.24.0] - 2024-07-11

### Added

* `Text::diff()` creates a text status emitter that does not do full dumps of test stderr/stdout, but only emits the diff of the changes
* Support `-Zbuild-std` by add
    * use `DependencyBuilder::build_std` to enable it

### Fixed

* Missing result dump if printing thread is too slow and the entire test exits before it is done.

### Changed

* `Config::output_conflict_handling` is now `Error` instead of `Bless`

## [0.23.0] - 2024-05-02

### Added

* `Config::custom_comments`
* `Revisioned::custom`
* `Flag` trait for custom `//@` flags
* `Build` trait for custom aux/dep build
    * `BuildManager` for deduplicating these builds on a per-`Config` basis

### Fixed

* folders and libraries linked by build scripts were ignored, causing linker failures

### Changed

* removed `Revisioned::no_rustfix` in favor of turning that into a rustc-specific custom flag
    * use `config.comment_defaults.base().set_custom("rustfix", RustFixMode::Everything);` to overwrite the `MachineApplicable` default
* removed `Revisioned::edition` in favor of turning that into a rustc-specific custom flag
* removed `Revisioned::needs_asm_support` in favor of turning that into a rustc-specific custom flag
* replaced `Mode::Run` with a rustc-specific run flag
* replaced rustfix with a rustc-specific rustfix flag
* replaced `rustfix` fields of `Mode::Fail` and `Mode::Yolo` by instead overwriting the rustc-specific custom flag
* aux builds and dependencies are now built *per* `Config` instead of being built just for the first `Config` and the result shared by the others
    * the configs could be different enough that aux builds built with a different config are incompatible (e.g. different targets).
* replaced `Revisioned::aux_builds` with a rustc-specific custom flag
* replaced `dependency_builder` and `dependency_manifest_path` with `DependencyBuilder` `Flag` that you an add to the default comments.
    * use `config.comment_defaults.base().set_custom("dependencies", DependencyBuilder::default());` to get the same behaviour as setting `Config.toml` as the `dependency_manifest_path`.
* updated `rustfix` from 0.6.1 to 0.8.1. This may cause additional suggestions to be applied that previously weren't.

### Changed
